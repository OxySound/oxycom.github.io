# Audible vs. near-ultrasonic

## Introduction
There are situations when data over sound is more viable than the standard solution over radio waves. 

The technology could be used where electro magnetic signals could interfere and are as such prohibited. 

It can be used as replacement for NFC and Bluetooth technology, a example is using sound data as a protocol for bus ticket validation.

From a security perspective it can be used as authentication mechanism to login to websites or even physical devices, arguing that they are less likely hacked since physical presence of listening device or person is needed for sniffing data
