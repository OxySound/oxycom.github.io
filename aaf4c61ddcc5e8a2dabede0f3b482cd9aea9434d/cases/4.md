# How it works

## Overview
OxySound enables your apps to send and receive information using sound. We encode your data as an audio signal, which can be transmitted by any device with a speaker and received by any device with a microphone with the OxySound SDK. It is designed to be robust over distances of several metres, in noisy, everyday environments.

As the transmission takes place entirely via audio signals, no internet connection or prior pairing is required, and any device within hearing range can receive the data.

Audio can be generated on-device from a dynamic data payload, or recorded as an audio file for later playback with or without a compainion audio track.
