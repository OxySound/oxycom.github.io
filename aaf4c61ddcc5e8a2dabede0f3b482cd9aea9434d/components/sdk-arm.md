# Getting Started - Ardunio

[![Audio](/assets/images/deck/board.png)](/assets/images/deck/board.png)

The OxySound SDK for Arm Cortex processors allows you to send and receive data-over-sound from within your embedded C/C++ application. It harnesses the powerful in-built FPU and optimised CMSIS-DSP library to enable on-chip encoding and decoding of OxySound signals.

## Requirements
To build an embedded system that uses the OxySound Arm SDK, you will need the following components.

Arm Cortex-M4 or Arm Cortex-M7 CPU
Audio ADC/DAC capable of at least 16kHz operation
For input, a microphone. We recommend a MEMS mic, ideally with a flat frequency response.
For output, a loudspeaker.
