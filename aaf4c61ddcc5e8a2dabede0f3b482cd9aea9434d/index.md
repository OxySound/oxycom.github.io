# Welcome to OxySound

## Introduction

OxySound enables your apps to send and receive information using sound. We encode your data as an audio signal, which can be transmitted by any device with a speaker and received by any device with a microphone and OxySound SDK. It is designed to be robust over distances of several metres, and in noisy, everyday environments.

As the transmission takes place entirely via audio signals, no internet connection or prior pairing is required, and any device within hearing range can receive the data.

OxySound signals can be generated on-device from a dynamic data payload, or recorded as an audio file for later playback â€“ like a sonic barcode.

OxySound is designed for simplicity, eliminating connectivity headaches and simplifying everyday tasks like connecting to Wi-Fi networks, sharing contact details, and making peer-to-peer payments.

## Why ?

You can find speakers in most places, and that makes this technology cheap and can be used in cases where communication is restricted.
