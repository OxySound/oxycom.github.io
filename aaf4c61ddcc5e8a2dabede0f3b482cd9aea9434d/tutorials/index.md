OxySound SDKs make sending data with audio incredibly straightforward for developers. Data is provided to the SDKs as an array of bytes. This means that any arbitrary data can be sent in its existing form without the SDK requiring any complicated conversions of data types or esoteric schema.
Transmission of the data can be via audible or inaudible ultrasonic audio depending on the configuration of your OxySound SDK. And you can get started with both the ultrasound and standard protocols for free in minutes.
